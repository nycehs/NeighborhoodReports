# Neighborhood Air Quality
<h3>About Neighborhood Air Quality</h3>
<p><strong>Air quality can vary</strong> <strong>from neighborhood to neighborhood</strong>. That is why the <strong>New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS)&nbsp;</strong>keeps track of street-level air pollution from about 100 locations throughout New York City every season. NYCCAS is part of <a title="OneNYC" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/html/onenyc/index.html">OneNYC</a>, New York City's long-term plan for sustainability.</p>
<p>The pollutants we measure are: <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx?#Fine_particulate_matter" target="_blank">fine particulate matter</a> (PM2.5),<span class="apple-converted-space"> <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Ground_level_ozone%20" target="_blank">ground-level ozone (O3, summer)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Nitrogen_oxides" target="_blank">nitrogen oxides (NOx)</a>, black carbon from diesel exhaust,&nbsp;<a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Sulfur_dioxide" target="_blank">sulfur dioxide (SO2, winter)</a><span class="apple-converted-space"> and<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Nickel" target="_blank">nickel (Ni, winter)</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>In NYC, levels of fine particulate matter, black carbon, and sulfur dioxide are higher in high-poverty neighborhoods.</p>
<h3>Neighborhood Air Quality and Health</h3>
<p>Pollutants may have negative effects on health, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing problems</strong>, such as coughing, and tightness in the chest</li>
<li><strong>Acute respiratory problems</strong>, such as worsening of <a title="Asthma" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/asthma.page">asthma</a> and reduced lung function</li>
<li><strong>Increased risk of heart attack</strong> and <strong>stroke</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low birthweight</strong> in newborns</li>
</ul>
<p>Air pollution may affect anyone, but <strong>certain groups are more vulnerable</strong> to risks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Older adults</strong></li>
<li><strong>Children</strong></li>
<li><strong>People with heart and respiratory conditions</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>To Reduce Health Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Know how <strong>sensitive you are to air pollution</strong>, and keep track of your local <a title="Air quality index" href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/aqi/aqi_forecast.cfm">Air Quality Index</a> (AQI). Avoid strenuous physical activity or going outside on poor air quality days.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce pollutant emissions</strong> by walking, biking, or using mass transit instead of a car, especially during rush hour.</li>
<li><strong>Support policies</strong> that promote public transportation and energy conservation.</li>
</ul>
