<h3>About Air Pollution</h3>
<p>Air quality is a&nbsp;<strong>measure of the condition of the air around us</strong>. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.</p>
<p>Like many cities, New York City's air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants,&nbsp;<strong><a title="Particulate matter" href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Particulate_Matter&quot;%20target=&quot;_blank&quot;">particulate matter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</strong><a title="Glossary" href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx"><strong>ground-level ozone</strong></a>, are of particular health concern.</p>
<p>Although New York City's air does not currently meet federal air quality standards,&nbsp;<strong>it has improved significantly over the past two decades</strong>.</p>
<h3>Air Pollution and Health</h3>
<p>Pollutants may affect human health negatively in a variety of ways. People may experience symptoms and health issues such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coughing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tightness in the chest</strong></li>
<li>Worsening of&nbsp;<strong><a title="asthma" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/asthma.page">asthma</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduced lung function</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased risk of heart attack</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>stroke</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low birthweight</strong>&nbsp;in newborns</li>
</ul>
<p>Air pollution may affect anyone.&nbsp;<strong>Certain groups may be more vulnerable</strong>&nbsp;to health risks from poor air quality, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Older adults (above 65 years)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Children</strong></li>
<li><strong>People with heart or lung conditions</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>To Reduce Health Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep track of your local&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/aqi/aqi_forecast.cfm">Air Quality Index</a></strong>&nbsp;(AQI) if you or your child is sensitive to air pollution. Avoid strenuous activity or going outside on poor air quality days.</li>
<li>Reduce air pollutants by&nbsp;<strong>walking, biking, or using mass transit</strong>&nbsp;instead of a car, especially during rush hour.</li>
<li><strong>Support policies</strong>&nbsp;that promote public transportation and energy conservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>About Neighborhood Air Quality</h3>
<p><strong>Air quality can vary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>from neighborhood to neighborhood</strong>. That is why the&nbsp;<strong>New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS)&nbsp;</strong>keeps track of street-level air pollution from about 100 locations throughout New York City every season. NYCCAS is part of&nbsp;<a title="OneNYC" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/html/onenyc/index.html">OneNYC</a>, New York City's long-term plan for sustainability.</p>
<p>The pollutants we measure are:&nbsp;<a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx?#Fine_particulate_matter" target="_blank">fine particulate matter</a>&nbsp;(PM2.5),<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;<a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Ground_level_ozone%20" target="_blank">ground-level ozone (O3, summer)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Nitrogen_oxides" target="_blank">nitrogen oxides (NOx)</a>, black carbon from diesel exhaust,&nbsp;<a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Sulfur_dioxide" target="_blank">sulfur dioxide (SO2, winter)</a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;and<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Nickel" target="_blank">nickel (Ni, winter)</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>In NYC,&nbsp;health impacts from fine particulate matter, black carbon, and sulfur dioxide are higher in high-poverty neighborhoods.</p>
