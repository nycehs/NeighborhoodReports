<h3>About Air Pollution</h3>
<p>Air quality is a <strong>measure of the condition of the air around us</strong>. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.</p>
<p>Like many cities, New York City's air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants,&nbsp;<strong><a title="Particulate matter" href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Particulate_Matter&quot;%20target=&quot;_blank&quot;">particulate matter</a> and </strong><a title="Glossary" href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx"><strong>ground-level ozone</strong></a>, are of particular health concern.</p>
<p>Although New York City's air does not current meet federal air quality standards,&nbsp;<strong>it has improved significantly over the past two decades</strong>.</p>
