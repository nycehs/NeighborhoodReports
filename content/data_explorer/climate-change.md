<h3>About Climate Change</h3>
<p>There is broad consensus within the scientific community that human activity is changing the Earth's climate through<strong> increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs)</strong> &mdash; primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) &mdash; in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Scientists have predicted that unless GHG emissions are substantially stemmed by the end of the century, climate change will become irreversible.</p>
<p>A key part of combating climate change is mitigation, which means <strong>reducing GHG emissions</strong>. Because the New York City emits nearly 0.25% of the world's total GHGs, decreasing our emissions and becoming more efficient will have a positive impact.</p>
<h3>Climate Change and Health</h3>
<p>Climate change can affect human health in many ways. For NYC, the two main climate change-related health risks are <strong>heat stress</strong> from increased number and intensity of heat waves, and <strong>health impacts from coastal storms</strong>. These impacts can affect the health of all New Yorkers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To Reduce Health Risks</h3>
<p>NYC has been responding to climate change and is working to improve the city's resilience against future climate change. To help reduce health risks related to climate change, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support policies that reduce GHGs</strong>, including improving public transportation, reducing waste, promoting energy efficiency and producing food and consumer goods locally.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Join a community group that focuses on climate change</strong>, and create or participate in community-based action plans that reduce health risks such as using buddy systems during <a title="Extreme heat and your health" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/emergency-preparedness/emergencies-extreme-weather-heat.page">heat waves</a>.</li>
</ul>
