# Lead Hazards
<h3>About Lead Hazards</h3>
<p>The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Nationwide, lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950, when lead-based paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978. Older layers of lead paint may still be present in older buildings and can become a lead hazard when the paint chips, peels or is abraded, or when renovations or repairs are conducted without taking appropriate actions to control dust. Families residing in older, poorly maintained housing are at higher risk for lead poisoning.</p>
<p>Dust from lead-based paint can contaminate floors and windowsills, and children's hands, and toys. Young children who crawl on the floor and put their hands and toys in their mouths are at greatest risk for lead poisoning through swallowing lead dust.</p>
<p>Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children. Information on other sources of lead poisoning can be found on the Health Department's website at: <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-children-and-lead-poisoning.page" target="_blank">http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-children-and-lead-poisoning.page</a><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/environmental/lead-homepage.shtml" target="_blank"><br /></a></p>
<h3>Lead Hazards and Health</h3>
<p>People may be exposed to lead by absorbing, breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust. Children with lead poisoning may develop health, learning and behavioral problems. The health effects of lead exposure may persist long after the exposure has stopped and a child's blood lead level (BLL) has declined. Fetal exposure to lead may also result in cognitive and developmental problems.</p>
<h3>About the Data and Indicators</h3>
<p>The indicators in this section focus on lead paint hazards, because these are the most common sources of lead poisoning for NYC children. Data on children exposed to lead can be found under the topic "Health Outcomes and Human Exposures" on this portal. <br /><br />Indicators are based on data from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/" target="_blank">Housing and Vacancy Survey</a> and the US Census 2000. These data provide estimates - not exact counts - of housing by year of construction and peeling paint status.</p>
<h3>Prevention</h3>
<h3>To prevent exposure to lead, landlords, tenants and parents can do the following:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In NYC, <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/Lead-Based-Paint.page" target="_blank">Local Law 1</a> requires landlords to inspect and fix lead paint hazards at no cost to tenants. The law applies to apartments if the following three conditions are met: 1) the building was built before 1960 (or between 1960 and 1978 if the owner knows the building has lead paint); 2) the building has three or more apartments; and 3) a child under six years old lives in the apartment.</li>
<li>If you are a tenant and live in a building covered by Local Law 1, fill out and return the Annual Notice from your landlord asking if a child under six years old lives with you. If you don't get the Annual Notice, call 311. If you have a new baby, or a child under six years old comes to live with you, tell your landlord in writing.</li>
<li>Call 311 if your landlord does not fix peeling paint, or if you think repair work is being done unsafely.</li>
<li>Call 311 if you live in a one- or two-family house with peeling paint and have a child under the age of six. Ask for the Health Department's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program.</li>
<li>Wash floors, window sills, hands, toys and pacifiers often.</li>
<li>Do not use imported foods, spices, clay pots and dishes, medicines, toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead.</li>
<li>All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two. Health care providers should also test other children who may be at risk, and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Messages</h3>
<p>The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Chipping, flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home. Children can be exposed by eating lead-based paint chips, chewing on objects painted with lead-based paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead.<br /><br /> Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children. Other sources of lead poisoning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imported herbal medicines and remedies (e.g., azarcon and greta used for upset stomach, and litargirio used for several purposes)</li>
<li>Painted and glazed clay pots and dishes used for cooking, serving or storing food&nbsp;</li>
<li>Imported cosmetics (e.g., kohl; surma; kajal)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Imported candies (e.g., candies made with chili powder; candies wrapped in lead-contaminated paper; candies stored in clay pots)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Imported toys and jewelry&nbsp;</li>
<li>Work involving the use of lead (recycling or making automobile batteries, radiator repair)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hobbies involving the use of lead (making stained-glass windows, hunting, fishing, target shooting).</li>
</ul>
