<h3>About Housing Quality</h3>
<p>No family should have to choose between affordable and healthy housing.<strong> All tenants are entitled to safe, decent and sanitary housing, which prevents disease and injury.</strong></p>
<p>In New York City, substandard or poor housing tends to cluster in neighborhoods. Homes that are deteriorating or dilapidated, or homes near buildings with broken or boarded-up windows, disproportionately tend to be in low-income neighborhoods, although the differences for these indicators have decreased.</p>
<h3>Housing and Health</h3>
<p><strong>Housing quality impacts health directly and indirectly.</strong></p>
<p>Cracks, holes, plumbing disrepair, peeling paint and other housing maintenance deficiencies are associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase likelihood of <strong>pest infestations</strong>, which can worsen <strong><a title="Asthma" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/asthma.page">asthma</a></strong></li>
<li>Exposure to lead where lead paint is present, which may cause <strong><a title="lead poisoning " href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-prevention.page">serious health problems</a></strong></li>
<li>Promotion of <strong>mold growth</strong>, which may cause <strong>allergic reactions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, occupants' or landlords' efforts to control these conditions through the use of hazardous chemical products can increase the <strong>risk of poisoning in the home</strong>. Disrepair may also cause <strong>injuries</strong>, including slips and falls, scalding and electrical shocks.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To Reduce Health Risks</h3>
<p><strong>All building owners are required by law to provide essential services such as heat and hot water, make timely repairs, and maintain a pest-free building</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tenant</span>:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report housing conditions</strong> such as peeling paint, water leaks, pest problems and mold to property owners. If landlords fail to fix the problems, call 311.</li>
<li>Use household cleaning products safely.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Provide a smoke-free home</strong> and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Inform the building's owner to have <strong>window guards installed</strong> if there is a child under the age of 11 living in a home. If landlords fail to install the required window guards, call 311.</li>
<li><strong>Test your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors</strong> and <strong>replace batteries</strong> at least twice a year.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">homeowner</span> or a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">landlord</span></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property owners are <strong>required by NYC law to install and maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detectors</strong> in residential units. Working detectors should be audible from any bedroom.</li>
<li><strong>Owners must provide homes and buildings free of pests</strong>, and employ pest control that uses preventive measures &mdash; not just pesticides.</li>
</ul>
