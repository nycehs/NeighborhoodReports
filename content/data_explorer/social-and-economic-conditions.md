# Social and Economic Conditions
<h3>Social and economic conditions</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Social and economic conditions affect people&rsquo;s health. These conditions (also called &ldquo;social determinants of health&rdquo;) are conditions that people may be born into or fall into over the course of their lives. They are shaped by local, national and global distribution of resources and power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">People tend to be healthier when they have access to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Economic and financial stability</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Higher education</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Adequate health care</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Healthy neighborhoods and safe, strong communities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But when people don&rsquo;t have access to these conditions, they experience worse health outcomes. This is <strong>health inequity</strong> &ndash; <strong>avoidable and unfair health outcomes. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Discrimination based on race (and other personal characteristics) often results in disparities in access to these conditions &ndash;and thus, disparities in health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
