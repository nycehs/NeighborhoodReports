# Asthma
<h3>About Asthma</h3>
<p>Asthma is a <strong>common disease in which the lungs become swollen, making breathing difficult</strong>. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest. The exact causes of asthma are not known. <strong>Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Asthma is a leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed school days in New York City's poorest neighborhoods. In NYC, asthma is more common among <strong>low-income Black and Latino children</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Asthma and the Environment</h3>

<ul>
